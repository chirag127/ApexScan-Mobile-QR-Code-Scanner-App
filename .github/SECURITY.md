# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining a secure codebase. As such, we actively support and patch the **latest stable version** of our application. Please ensure you are using the most recent release to benefit from all security updates.

*   **Latest Stable Release:** Fully supported.
*   **Older Versions:** Older versions are not actively monitored for security vulnerabilities and may be vulnerable. We strongly advise upgrading.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover any vulnerability in our project, please report it to us immediately.

We appreciate your efforts in keeping our project and its users safe.

**Please report vulnerabilities by:**

1.  Sending an email to `chirag127@users.noreply.github.com` with the subject line "Vulnerability Report".
2.  Providing as much detail as possible, including:
    *   The affected version(s) of the application.
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Any proof-of-concept code, if available.
    *   Your suggested remediation, if any.

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and will provide an estimated timeframe for a fix. We will not publish any details of the vulnerability until it has been fixed and deployed.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure process. Details of vulnerabilities will only be released publicly after a fix has been deployed and users have had a reasonable opportunity to upgrade.

We do not offer bug bounty programs at this time, but we are grateful for all contributions to the security of our project.
